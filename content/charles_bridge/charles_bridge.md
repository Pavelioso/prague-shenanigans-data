The bridge is a popular tourist destination and provides stunning views of Prague Castle and the river.

Good things to know:
- Go early in the morning if you want to have surreal atmosphere.
- This is probably the most "I'll just go to a half of this bridge and go back" bridge in the world - the half of the bridge close to Prague Castle is half "emptier" than it's other half. Get it?
- The lights on the crosswalk are timed, and the button's don't change anything.



Welcome and enjoy, yo!

In this case I need to get the text a bit longer, 
does the scroll box work... 
## DOES THE SCROLL BOX WORK, MAN?

I am quite certain it should be still. 
What is certainty? It's definitely not definive. It's just there. Present.
